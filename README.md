| 4 | [Super Store Consult](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/clinton.bullock/viz/Sprint4FinalProject-ClintonBullock/ProfitsLosses2) | The dashboard references a **Tableau visualization tracking profit and loss by month and region**, featuring interactive filters and trend lines. I imported and transformed the dataset in Tableau, then designed calculated fields and dynamic charts to compare revenues, costs, and net change. My technical stack included **Tableau Desktop/Public**, **SQL for data preparation**, and you likely leveraged **calculated fields** (e.g., profit margin) plus built-in visualization and filtering features to drive insights.|
| 5 | [Super Store Returns](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/clinton.bullock/viz/Spint5FinalProject/Story) | An additional Returns Analysis for SuperStore. Focusing on Product Return Trends via Tableau. | 
| 6 | [Shopify](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13lbtLG9hg92o74woSwebbsXEfaQ2ZUNQziFmQbUG_n8/edit?usp=sharing)| Platform Analysis on the landscape of the Shopify App platform finding KPIs that play into its success via Power BI. |
