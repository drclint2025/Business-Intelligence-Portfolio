# Business Intelligence Portfolio
Projects I worked on while attending the Business Intelligence Analytics TripleTen Bootcamp.
| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 0 | [Fresh Beats](https://github.com/drclint2025/Business-Intelligence-Portfolio/tree/main/Fresh%20Beats) | Provided insights and visuals to evaluate Fresh Beats’ artist promotion effectiveness, user engagement, and genre-based recommendations, matching business challenges around exposure and conversion. Leveraged Google Sheets/Docs for data presentation, enriched with copy-pasted charts—and deployed analytical reasoning grounded in pre-existing visualizations to inform stakeholder recommendations.|
| 1 | [Manhattan Vacation Rentals](https://github.com/drclint2025/Business-Intelligence-Portfolio/tree/main/Manhattan%20Vacation%20Rentals) | A spreadsheet analysis identifying the most attractive Manhattan neighborhoods for vacation rentals by cleaning data, using pivot tables on review counts and bedroom sizes, and highlighting top-performing 1‑bed and studio listings. Revenue was then calculated via calendar data, summing nightly prices on booked dates and projecting annual earnings for the highest-grossing listing.|
| 3 | [Zuber Database](https://github.com/drclint2025/Business-Intelligence-Portfolio/tree/main/Zuber%20Database) | Demand analysis consult for the rideshare company Zuber to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides via SQL database.|
| 4 | [Super Store](https://github.com/drclint2025/Business-Intelligence-Portfolio/tree/main/Super%20Store) | The dashboard provides a dynamic visualization of monthly profit and loss across regions, enhanced with interactive filters and trend lines. It leverages a tech stack including Tableau Desktop/Public for visualization and calculated fields (e.g., profit margins).|
| 5 | [Super Store II](https://github.com/drclint2025/Business-Intelligence-Portfolio/tree/main/Super%20Store%20II) | A coherent sequence of interactive charts, captions, and annotations to guide users from overarching trends down to specific regional and categorical profit insights. It leverages a tech stack of Tableau Public/Desktop for storytelling and advanced calculated fields to craft a data-driven narrative.| 
| 6 | [Shopify](https://github.com/drclint2025/Business-Intelligence-Portfolio/tree/main/Shopify)|A dashboard mapped the Shopify app landscape, tracking app counts, review trends, and comparing developer-average ratings and helpfulness. Developed with Power BI Desktop using reviews and apps tables, the report incorporates count/sum measures, scatter and line charts, and threshold filters for enhanced interactive insights.|
