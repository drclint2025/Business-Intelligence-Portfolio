| 4 | [Super Store Consult](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/clinton.bullock/viz/Sprint4FinalProject-ClintonBullock/ProfitsLosses2) | The dashboard references a **Tableau visualization tracking profit and loss by month and region**, featuring interactive filters and trend lines. I imported and transformed the dataset in Tableau, then designed calculated fields and dynamic charts to compare revenues, costs, and net change. My technical stack included **Tableau Desktop/Public**, **SQL for data preparation**, and you likely leveraged **calculated fields** (e.g., profit margin) plus built-in visualization and filtering features to drive insights.|
| 5 | [Super Store Returns](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/clinton.bullock/viz/Spint5FinalProject/Story) | This Tableau project crafts a series of connected story-points—each featuring interactive charts, filters, captions, and annotations—to guide viewers from high-level trends down to specific regional and categorical profit insights. The technical stack included Tableau Public/Desktop for storytelling and dashboard creation, SQL for upstream data preparation, and advanced calculated fields and interactive story-point elements to create a coherent, data-driven narrative.| 
| 6 | [Shopify](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13lbtLG9hg92o74woSwebbsXEfaQ2ZUNQziFmQbUG_n8/edit?usp=sharing)|I built a Power BI dashboard analyzing Shopify app landscape and review data—counting apps, tracking review volume over time, and comparing average ratings and helpfulness by developer. I created visualizations using count and sum measures, scatter and line charts, and applied filters (e.g., review thresholds) to highlight trends and developer performance. This project leveraged **Power BI Desktop**, imported data models with **reviews** and **apps** tables, and used built-in measures and visuals for interactive insights.|
